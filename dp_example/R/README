There is a script called "quick.start.R", which can be executed to
reproduce the experiments used to generated the data used to plot the
graphs corresponding to Figures 3 and 4 of the article. The script can
then be followed to the corresponding related functions, which can be
analysed to obtain a more detailed knowledge of the framework.

To run the quick start script, run the following commands on a
terminal:

R CMD SHLIB bj_evaluate_policy.c

R

source("quick.start.R")

The script will run the experiments and then plot the correponding
graphs.
